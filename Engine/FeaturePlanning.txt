Hedge Engine
- Backend(s): SDL3 (PySDL3), managed via abstraction layer & allows for new backends
- Resolution: 424x240 base with custom scaling 

  Custom ratio support (e.g. 16:9, 16:10, 4:3, 17:9, etc.)

  Allows for custom W/H scaling (e.g. you can have a scale of 2W/3H)
- Supported Inputs: Keyboards & Controllers
- Style: Stage-based

  Stages are the separate screens/rooms that are usually shown in-order but can jump to other ones regardless of order.
- Stage system: A stage in this context is usually made up of:
  - Title
  - Stage logic
  - Spritesheets
  - Object definitions in binaries (background parallax features, other objects, etc.)
  - Editable with a custom, open-source stage editor.

Project Echidna
- **Viewport res support:** Widescreen, ultrawide & 4:3
  - Depending on the screen resolution, there will be accommodations.
- **OST:** Having the option between:
  - Unchanged SMPS rips
  - "Restorations" (Source instruments + PSG3 -> Hi hats)
    - Big thanks to Sengin31 on YouTube for the sample pack I used + the hi hats
    - SVG 360 (supervideogamer3607) for the MJ beatboxing vox (S3 Credits Theme)
  - Full-on remasters (restoration + other enhancements) (PROBABLY WON'T EXIST DON'T GET YOUR HOPES UP)
- **Consistent 60 FPS+ gameplay:**
  - (maybe with interpolation?)
  - Smoother objects like Monkey Dude & gumball machine crank (movements are more perpetuated by math rather than prearranged frames)
### Potential Features? (I don't know if I could add these)
- A "Throwback mode" (4:3 with additional tweaks)
- An original mode (embed of an emulator like BlastEm with a Sonic 3K ROM supplied by the user)
