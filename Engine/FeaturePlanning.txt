-- High-quality VGM rips of the original soundtrack, now with source samples designed to fall right in between a remaster and just the regular tracks.
- 60 FPS+ smooth gameplay experience
-- Smooth interpolation maybe (?)
-- Rectified smoothed movements of things like AIZ badniks, swings and Blue Spheres
- BIG MAYBE, a Classic mode (remaster in 4:3) and an Original mode (integrated BlastEm with Sonic 3K rom provided by the user)
